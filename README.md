# HR Analytics

## Project Overview

- This project focuses on HR Analytics, specifically analyzing factors that influence employee retention rates. Using employee data such as education background, job role, commute time, and more, the project aims to uncover patterns and provide insights into workforce management.

- HR Analytics (also known as People Analytics, Talent Analytics, or Workforce Analytics) is the practice of collecting, organizing, and analyzing HR-related data to measure and improve employee performance and organizational effectiveness.

- By applying data analytics to human resources, organizations can identify challenges like high turnover rates, skill gaps, and low productivity, and address them with data-driven strategies.
