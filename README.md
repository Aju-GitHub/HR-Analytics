# HR-Analytics
A project about HR analytics, where employee retention rate has been analyzed using employees data like previous education, job role, time to travel to office ect.
HR analytics is the process of collecting and analysing Human Resources (HR) data to 
improve employee performance in an organization. This process is sometimes called Talent 
Analytics, People Analytics, or Workforce Analytics.
This data analysis method takes data collected by HR on a regular basis and relates it to HR 
and organizational goals. This provides measurable evidence of how HR initiatives are contributing to organizational goals and strategies. For example, if a software engineering 
firm has high employee turnover, the company is not operating at a fully productive level.
It takes time and investment to get your workforce up to a fully productive level. HR 
analytics provides data-driven insights into what is working and what isn't, so organizations 
can make improvements and plan more effectively for the future. As in the example above, 
knowing what causes a company's high turnover rate can provide valuable insight into how to 
reduce it. By reducing turnover, the company can increase turnover and productivity. Most 
companies already have data collected on a regular basis. So why a special form of analytics? 
Can't HR just see the data they already have? Unfortunately, raw data alone does not provide 
useful insights. It's like looking at a big table full of numbers and words. Without 
organization and direction, data seems meaningless. Organizing, comparing, and analysing
this raw data can yield useful insights. They can help answer questions like:
• What patterns can be revealed in employee turnover?
• How long does it take to hire employees?
• What amount of investment is needed to get employees up to a fully productive 
speed?
• Which of our employees are most likely to leave within the year?
• Are learning and development initiatives having an impact on employee 
performance?
Organizations can concentrate on making the required improvements and planning for future 
initiatives when they have data-supported evidence. It is not surprising that many companies 
using HR analytics are attributing performance improvement to HR initiatives given the 
capability to provide accurate answers to crucial organizational questions.
